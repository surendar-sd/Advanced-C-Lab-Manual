EXP NO:1 C PROGRAM FOR ARRAY OF STRUCTURE TO CHECK ELIGIBILITY FOR THE VACCINE.

Aim:
To write a C program for array of structure to check eligibility for the vaccine person age above 6 years of age.

Algorithm:
1.	Declare structure eligible with age (integer) and n (character array)
2.	Declare variable e of type eligible
3.	Input age and name using scanf, store in e
4.	If e.age <= 6
-	Print "Vaccine Eligibility: No"
Else
-	Print "Vaccine Eligibility: Yes"
5.	Print details (e.age, e.n)
6.	Return 0
 
Program:
 ```
#include <stdio.h>

struct eligible {
    char n[50];
    int age;
};

int main() {
    struct eligible e[100];
    int n, i;

    printf("Enter number of persons: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("\nEnter name: ");
        scanf("%s", e[i].n);
        printf("Enter age: ");
        scanf("%d", &e[i].age);
    }

    printf("\n--- Vaccine Eligibility Check ---\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("\nName: %s", e[i].n);
        printf("\nAge: %d", e[i].age);
        if (e[i].age <= 6)
            printf("\nVaccine Eligibility: No\n");
        else
            printf("\nVaccine Eligibility: Yes\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```


Output:
```
Enter number of persons: 3

Enter name: Arjun
Enter age: 5

Enter name: Praveen
Enter age: 12

Enter name: Sneha
Enter age: 8

Ex No 5 : C PROGRAM TO DISPLAY STUDENT DETAILS USING STRUCTURE

Aim:
The aim of this program is to dynamically allocate memory to store information about multiple subjects (name and marks), input the details for each subject, and then display the stored information. Finally, it frees the allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

Algorithm:
1.Input the number of subjects.

2.Read the integer value n from the user, which represents the number of subjects.

3.Dynamically allocate memory:

4.Use malloc to allocate memory for n subjects. Each subject has a name (array of characters) and marks (integer).

5.If memory allocation fails (i.e., the pointer s is NULL), display an error message and exit the program.

6.Input the details of each subject

7.Use a for loop to read the name and marks of each subject using scanf. For each subject, store the name as a string and marks as an integer in the dynamically allocated memory.

8.Display the details of each subject

9.Use another for loop to print the name and marks of each subject.

10.Free the allocated memory

11.After all operations are done, call free(s) to release the dynamically allocated memory.

12.Return from the main function

13.End the program by returning 0.

Program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct student {
    char name[50];
    int marks;
};

int main() {
    struct student *s;
    int n, i;

    printf("Enter the number of subjects: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Dynamically allocate memory
    s = (struct student*)malloc(n * sizeof(struct student));

    if (s == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Input student details
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("\nEnter name of subject %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%s", s[i].name);
        printf("Enter marks for %s: ", s[i].name);
        scanf("%d", &s[i].marks);
    }

    // Display student details
    printf("\n--- Student Details ---\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Subject %d: %s\n", i + 1, s[i].name);
        printf("Marks: %d\n\n", s[i].marks);
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    free(s);

    return 0;
}
```




Output:


```
Enter the number of subjects: 3

Enter name of subject 1: Maths
Enter marks for Maths: 95

Enter name of subject 2: Science
Enter marks for Science: 88

Enter name of subject 3: English
Enter marks for English: 92

--- Student Details ---
Subject 1: Maths
Marks: 95

Subject 2: Science
Marks: 88

Subject 3: English
Marks: 92
